## Instructions

Cheallenge yourself to memorize cards in a grid of 16 pairs. Click on a card to flip it over. Click a second card to attempt to make a match. To win the game you must reveal all of the cards by correctly matching pairs.

As your number of moves increases, your star rating will decrease at set intervals. Beating the game in fewer moves will require concentration and memorization.
